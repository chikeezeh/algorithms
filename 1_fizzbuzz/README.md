# **OVERVIEW**
This program takes an Integer, then prints out every number from 1 to that
Integer.
If the Integer is divisible by 3, the program prints Fizz, if the Integer is
divisible by 5 the program prints Buzz, if the Integer is divisible by 3 and 5
the program prints FizzBuzz.
The program is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For example, given the number 5,
```
fizzBuzz(5) =
        1
        2
        Fizz
        4
        Buzz
```
To run the code type <pythonX fizzbuzz.py>, where X is the python version. The
program would ask for an Integer, provide one and see it do its magic.
**NOTE:** The program doesn't validate inputs, so you will get an error if you
don't input and Integer.
