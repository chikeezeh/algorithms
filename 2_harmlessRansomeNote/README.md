# **OVERVIEW**
This program takes two sets of string, noteText and magazineText,
the goal of the program is to determine if the strings found in noteText can
all be found in magazineText.  
The program is written in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

For example, given the number two sets of strings,
>noteText = 'This is a secret note for you from a secret admirer'

>magazineText ='puerto rico is a great place you must hike far from town to find
>a secret waterfall that I am an admirer of but note that it is not as hard as it
>seems this is my advice for you'

```
harmlessRansomeNote(noteText, magazineText) =
  False

```
The program returns **False** because the word **secret** appears twice in
noteText but once in magazineText.

To run the code copy the code to your machine, change the **noteText** and
**magazineText** variables, then type pythonX harmlessRansomeNote.py in your
console to run the program.
