In halls where bytes and circuits dwell,
Where data flows and compilers swell,
A whisper stirred the silent gloom—
Of freedom born in hacker’s room.

No walls of gold, no gates of chain,
Just open fields in bright domain.
The seeds were sown in Nordic land,
By Linus with a coder’s hand.

"I make this free," the young man said,
"No price to chain the path I tread.
Let knowledge flow like rivers wide—
Come join me, friends, and code with pride."

From kernel roots the tree did grow,
With bashful bash and systems low.
A scheduler that dreams in ticks,
And pipes that pass like clever tricks.

In bits and bytes the kernel breathes,
With drivers deep like hidden sheaths.
IRQ and syscall dance as kin—
The song of process shall begin.

Its heart, the kernel—tight and small,
Yet vast enough to power all.
With sysfs, procfs, pages swapped,
In endless loop, it never stopped.

The shell—a poet's interface,
Where words take flight and leave no trace.
A prompt, a flash, then magic done,
With "grep" and "awk" beneath the sun.

Oh ls, reveal thy treasures here,
While chmod guards what's truly dear.
With top I watch the system's soul,
And cron ensures it meets each goal.

In bash or zsh, scripts arise—
The automation of the wise.
No need for clicks, no need for flair,
Just logic plain, and systems bare.

The file tree tall with ancient limbs—
From /root to /dev, a hymn of hymns.
/etc where configs lie still,
/usr where users test their skill.

/var shall write, /tmp shall fade,
/proc shows how the beast is made.
Each mount a tale, each inode name—
A structure rich, yet none the same.

The permissions speak in riddle runes—
Of users, groups, and world in tunes.
With chown, I shape the realm anew—
And give to each what they are due.

Its creed is “Free,” but not just beer—
It’s liberty that engineers.
The GPL, in Stallman’s hand,
Forged freedoms few could understand.

Not closed behind a corporate veil,
Nor bound in court with license frail.
Its soul is shared in every line—
Its truth, a flame no laws confine.

And from this source a forest sprung:
Of distros broad and proudly sung.

Debian stands in stable might,
With apt so clean and upgrades light.
Fedora dreams on bleeding edge,
Where Red Hat makes its solemn pledge.

Arch, the minimalist's delight,
A rolling wave of daily fight.
Gentoo builds from deepest stone—
A shrine for those who roam alone.

Ubuntu came to welcome all—
With ease to rise, no need to fall.
Pop! and Mint and Manjaro rise—
Each painting Linux in new guise.

It powers routers, clouds and steel,
And phones that in your palms you feel.
It rides in cars and space-bound drones,
In datacenters’ guarded zones.

Android bears its beating core,
A billion pockets now explore.
And servers hum its steady tune,
From morning sun to silver moon.

No king commands it from above,
Its rule is merit, skill, and love.
Its coders work in dark and day—
And give the gift, then walk away.

It brought together minds afar,
Who met through mail and IRC star.
Git came forth from kernel’s flame,
And changed the world in versioned name.

The CLI, for some, too bare—
Yet GUIs bloom with beauty rare.
Gnome and KDE display
A windowed world in GTK.

XFCE for speed refined,
While i3 suits the keyboard mind.
Choice is power, and choice is vast—
For every user, a fitting cast.

Security, thy noble vow—
No backdoor here, no hidden cow.
With SELinux keeping watch,
And AppArmor’s silent notch.

Though threats may come from east and west,
The penguin stands and guards its nest.
Its eyes are many, wide and clear—
A thousand watchers hold it dear.

No secret lies it dares to keep,
Its heart exposed, its logic deep.
So bugs may fall, and flaws may fade—
When all can see how it's been made.

And yet, beyond the code and shell,
Beyond the files and process well,
There beats a pulse, a dream that stays—
A vision cast in hacker's praise.

To learn, to teach, to build, to share—
To shape the world with utmost care.
No patents here, no profit chains—
Just freedom coursing through our veins.

We gather still, in forums bright,
In wikis deep and mailing plight.
We share the patch, the fix, the lore—
And open wide each system’s door.

So raise a toast with mug or key,
To Tux and all who dare be free.
For Linux is no thing you own—
But something greater, ever grown.

It lives in lines of humble code,
In silent servers long abode.
It thrives where minds are brave and bold—
And never does what it is told.

A hymn, a pledge, a cry of cheer—
For all who walk the penguin’s sphere.
In every man and every dmesg,
We find the soul of Linux's edge.

So if you seek to understand
The world built not by single hand,
Then trace the logs, the source, the flame—
And know: the Penguin takes no name.

For Linux lives where minds are free—
A code, a cause, a legacy.
